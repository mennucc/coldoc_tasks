==================
ColDoc Task server
==================

This package implements a simple task server,
that can run jobs in background.

It is used in the
`ColDoc project <https://mennucc.github.io/ColDoc_project>`_

It is a simpler alternative to fancier solutions, such as 
`*Celery* <https://mennucc.github.io/ColDoc_project/build/html/install.html>`_
At the same time, this package contains a wrapper, so that
the code using this package can be switched to using *Celery*
if later needed.
(In a sense, this package can be seen as a gentle way of using  *Celery*)

The code can be easily integrated in a Django portal.
